# Declarative Web Scraping with ChatGPT

This api is to demonstrate the use of chat gpt for web scraping.

One important thing to note: the api will only work with json formatted strings. The html strings passed into the array need to be serialized as json, otherwise a null object will be returned.  

See the swagger page for api documentation.
